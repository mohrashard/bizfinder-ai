## 🧐 The Problem

**Lead generation is broken.**
- ❌ **Manual Searching**: Scrolling through Google Maps for hours is tedious.
- ❌ **No "Negative" Filters**: You can't ask Google for *"businesses WITHOUT a website"* or *"restaurants with BAD ratings."*
- ❌ **Generic Data**: Most tools just give you a list. They don't analyze the *opportunity*.

## 💡 The Solution: BizFinder AI

**BizFinder AI** transforms how you find clients. It combines **Google Maps data** with **Gemini AI** to act as your autonomous sales researcher.

> *"Find me dentists in Miami with no website"* -> **Done.**
>
> *"Show me mechanics in Dubai with low ratings"* -> **Done.**

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔍 **Smart AI Search**
Stop clicking filters. Just type what you want. We use **Google Gemini 2.0** to understand complex queries like:
- *"Plumbers in Toronto with no website and low reviews"*
- *"Gyms in New York open now"*

### 📊 **Opportunity Scoring**
Don't just get leads; get **insights**. Every business is scored (0-100) based on potential:
- **+30 pts**: Missing Website (Prime candidate for Web Design)
- **+20 pts**: Missing Social Meida (Prime for Social Media Marketing)
- **+15 pts**: Low Ratings (Prime for Reputation Management)

### 🤖 **AI Prompt Generation**
Generate custom, highly-specific pitches in one click.
- **Website Pitch**: Analyses the business data to write a compelling email about why they need a site.
- **Marketing Pitch**: Generates a tailored social media strategy based on their specific niche and location.

### 🗂️ **Built-in CRM**
- **Save Leads**: Build your pipeline directly in the app.
- **Track Status**: Mark leads as "New", "Contacted", "Call Later", etc.
- **Export Data**: One-click CSV export to move data to your favorite tools (HubSpot, instantly.ai, etc.).

### 🎨 **Premium Experience**
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Beautiful, modern dashboard.
- **Dark Mode**: Easy on the eyes for late-night grinding.
- **Mobile Optimized**: Find leads on the go.
